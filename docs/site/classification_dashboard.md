# Classification Dashboard

The classification dashboard presents classifications from your lab that require some actions (aka classifications with open flags).

If you get regular emails about classifications requiring attention, it is in reference to the classifications that appear on the dashboard.

See [Classification Flags](classification_flags) for details.
