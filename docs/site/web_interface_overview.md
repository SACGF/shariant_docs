# Web Interface Overview

It is intended that the majority of classification data from your lab be automatically synced to Shariant. Shariant is not intended to be a place for large manual data entry. Conversely classifications in Shariant should be automatically downloaded to your curation system.

Given this, there are still plenty of uses for the web interface.

* [Identify and fix issues with classifications from your lab.](classification_dashboard)
* [Resolve any classification discordances.](classification_discordance)
* [Manually find classifications.](classification_listing)
