# Classification Listing

The classification listing page lets you filter through all the shared classifications in Shariant.

(!) You may see a field called "Create Classification", if you are having your classifications automatically synced avoid this.

Filter options

You can filter on Gene Symbol.
Lab name (helpful to filter to your own lab to verify records)
Flags - if you select multiple flags then records returned must have at least one of those flags.
See [Classification Flags](classification_flags) for details.

Using Shariant's overall search (top right), you can still search for a specific variant.

### Records Syncing Down

Hopefully as well as uploading to Shariant, your system is also configured to download records from Shariant and import them into your curation system.
If this is the case it is recommended that you search for variants within your own classification system as you are probably well versed in its interface.
