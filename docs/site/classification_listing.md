# Classification Listing

(!) The classification listing page has not yet been optimised for Shariant use.
You may find it not optimal to use currently.

### Records Syncing Down

Hopefully as well as uploading to Shariant, your system is also configured to download records from Shariant and import them into your curation system.
If this is the case it is recommended that you search for variants within your own classification system as you are probably well versed in its interface.

### Using the Shariant Classification Listing

The classification listing shows classifications alongside a pie chart that shows overall clinical significance of all records stored.
Also present is a stacked bar chart that shows you how much of each kind clinical significance is stored for each gene.

Clicking on any of these graph segments filters the results to that significance or gene/significance combination.

There is also a Mine checkbox that will only show records if you are recorded as the "owner" of the record.

There is a Gene filter where you can search using the Ensembl Gene ID or gene name (but a single ensemble gene must be seleced)

The "Simple Filter" provides limited filtering options. It is intended that this filter interface be replaced in future.

Otherwise you can navigate through the table of results.

### Export

You can also export the single record as CSV, a preview of the Clinvar format or as a report.
(The report does require that your lab has a report template pre-configured.)

### Literature Citations

Any PMID references in the form of PMID:123456 from anywhere within the classification will be summed together and listed at the bottom of the classification.
