# Evidence Keys Overview

A variant classification in Shariant is mostly comprised of evidence key values.

Some extra notes

* Evidence keys are flat, e.g. a key will not be nested within another key.
* Each key is of a certain type, see [Evidence Key Types](types.md).
* Each evidence key supports a free text "note".
