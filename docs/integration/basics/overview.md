# Integration Overview

### Your variant classifications into Shariant

Goals:

* Ensure we can consistantly match records to variants.
* Compare classifications (across different labs) for the same variant in a meaningful way.
* Format the classification for submission to other databases such as Clinvar, which will have their own structure requirements.
* Avoid providing patient identifiable information.

### Our variant classifications into your curation system

Goals:

* Ability to retrieve an extract from our Shariant and import it in a different track into yours
and/or
* Be able to quickly use the web interface to search for relevant variants
