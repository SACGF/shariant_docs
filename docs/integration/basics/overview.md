# Integration Overview

You have variant classifications in your own curation system and you want them to be in ours.

What are the basic goals here:

* Ensure we can consistantly match records to variants.
* Compare classifications (across different labs) for the same variant in a meaningful way.
* Format the classification for submission to other databases such as Clinvar, which will have their own structure requirements.
* (Avoid providing patient identifiable information).

Also we have variant classifications in our database and you want access to them in your curation system.

What are the basic goals here:

* Ability to retrieve an extract from our Shariant and import it in a different track into yours
and/or
* Be able to quickly use the web interface to search for relevant variants
